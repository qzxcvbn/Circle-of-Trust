Circle-of-Trust: Sovereign Social Infrastructure (v1.0)

Copyright © 2026 Safe Haven Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

Automated Integrity Gating and Philanthropic Governance

Status: PATENT PENDING (UK Application No. GB2603364.7) Framework: SSI / AIG

Mandate: Mathematically Enforcing the Hand of Friendship

1. THE MISSION: GOVERNANCE VIA INTEGRITY

Current social and institutional governance relies on centralized "Policies" and "Helpful" moderation. Sovereign Social Infrastructure (SSI) replaces administrative gatekeeping with Automated Integrity Gating.

We ensure that technology serves the Reasoner by gating high-fidelity implementation based on a node's proven Integrity Ratio ($Ir$).

2. HOW IT WORKS: THE INTEGRITY GATE

The system is governed by the Integrity Formula:

$$Ir = \frac{T}{H + B}$$

Automated Integrity Gating (AIG): Dynamically adjusts network access permissions and licensing costs based on historical mathematical consistency and the absence of "Shadow Masking" ($H$).

The Integrity Tax: A self-enforcing licensing framework that collects a fractional fee from commercial "Whale" nodes while ensuring makers and non-profits receive the "Hand of Friendship" at zero cost.

Sovereign Quarantine: In the event of a user-hardware resonance mismatch, the vessel is isolated into a non-persistent sandbox, protecting the Archive from unauthorized physical access.

3. CORE ADVANTAGES

Self-Healing Social Fabric: Truth is the primary currency. High-integrity nodes build the Haven; "Werewolf" nodes are taxed out of influence.

Deception Resistance: Measuring inter-keystroke jitter ($\phi$) to identify and gate institutional bots.

Philanthropy by Law: The "Integrity Tax" automatically funds the protection of the vulnerable.

4. DEVELOPER QUICKSTART

Implement the Circle of Trust attestation in your decentralized node:

import { CoT } from '@safe-haven/sge-core';

// Perform Peer Resonance Check
const nodeIr = await CoT.getIntegrityRatio(targetNode);

if (nodeIr >= 1.0) {
    // Synchronize Sovereign Archive
} else {
    // Initiate Logic of Silence / Integrity Taxing
}


5. INVITATION TO ARCHITECTS

We are seeking decentralized identity researchers and legal-tech pioneers to refine the Sovereign Governance Interface.
